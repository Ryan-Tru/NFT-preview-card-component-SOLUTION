### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

  I first made the skeleton with HTML, then I further styled it using CSS, positioning divs and all the things inside.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project helped further refine my understanding of positioning elements, and styling with css. The hardest part for me was making the NFT image hoverable.

### Continued development

I want to continue to refine my css by further developing my skills with flexbox and grid
